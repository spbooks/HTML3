      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Bubble Under is a group of diving enthusiasts based in the
          south-west UK who meet up for diving trips in the summer 
          months when the weather is good and the bacon rolls are           
          flowing. We arrange weekends away as small groups to cut           
          the costs of accommodation and travel and to ensure that           
          everyone gets a trustworthy dive buddy.</p>
      <p>Although we're based in the south-west, we don't stay on
          our own turf: past diving weekends away have included           
          trips up to Scapa Flow in Scotland and to Malta's numerous            
          wreck sites.</p>
      <p>When we're not diving, we often meet up in a local pub to 
          talk about our recent adventures (any excuse, eh?).</p>     
      <p>Or as our man Bob Dobalina would put it:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Happiness is a dip in the ocean followed by a pint or
            two of Old Speckled Hen. You can quote me on that!"</p>
